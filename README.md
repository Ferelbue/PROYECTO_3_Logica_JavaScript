# LOGIC JAVASCRIPT - EMPANADAS CHALLENGE:fork_and_knife::dollar:
This is the repository with the solution to the logic problem proposed in the Full Stack Developer Bootcamp. 
The problem consists in optimize the way in which some empanadillas are ordered in order to pay the lowest possible price.
The solution have to pass a testing generated by the tachers using the framework Jest to ensure correctness of the JavaScript codebase.

## Features :star2:

- **Differents solutions:** I have made two diferents solutions. Firstly, I made a solution in which I passed the mandatory tests but did not pass some other combinations that I proposed. So I decided to do some mathematical calculations in order to successfully pass all the possible combinations.🔁
- **Development time:** I started last Friday and on the same day I got the first solution. Over the weekend I came up with the second way to solve it.⏰
- **Testing expansion:** I have added more possible combinations to the test file to improve the quality of my code.🔍

## Getting-started :ok_hand:
To run this problem you must have in your computer:
- Internet conexion
- Visual Studio Code
- Git Hub repository
***

## Launch :rocket:
To launch and test the code you should follow the following steps:
- Clone the repository **PROYECTO_3_Logica_JavaScript** of my github profile [Fernando](https://github.com/Ferelbue/PROYECTO_3_Logica_JavaScript.git).
- Open it in Visual Studio Code.
- Inntall the npm packages: ```npm install```
- Run the JEST testing test: ```npm run test```

## Known bugs :alien:
- I'm sure there is one of the hundreds of possible combinations that would fail. But I have tried a few combinations and it works perfectly.
